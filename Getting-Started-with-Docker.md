## Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping & running distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs or cloud. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The Docker Platform consists of multiple product/tools, including the Docker Engine, Images, Containers, and Hub, among others.

The Docker platform is the only container platform to build, secure and manage the widest array of applications from development to production both on premises and in the cloud.
